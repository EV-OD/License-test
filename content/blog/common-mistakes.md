The practical driving test, or "trial," is often the most nerve-wracking part of getting a driving license in Nepal. While practice is essential, knowing common pitfalls can also help you prepare better. Here are some frequent mistakes to avoid:

### 1. Poor Observation
Failing to check mirrors (rear-view and side mirrors) regularly, especially before changing lanes, turning, or stopping. Also, not checking blind spots is a major error.

### 2. Incorrect Use of Signals
Signaling too late, too early, or not at all. Ensure your signals accurately reflect your intentions and are given in good time.

### 3. Speed Control Issues
Driving too fast for the conditions or too slowly, impeding traffic flow. Maintain appropriate speed according to speed limits and road/traffic situations.

### 4. Steering Control Problems
Over-steering, under-steering, or jerky movements. Aim for smooth and controlled steering, especially during turns and maneuvers like the "8" shape.

### 5. Difficulty with Maneuvers
Struggling with specific trial components like the figure "8", u-turn, incline start (ukalo), or parking. Practice these maneuvers extensively until you are confident.

### 6. Not Following Traffic Signs or Markings
Ignoring stop signs, lane discipline, or other road markings. This shows a lack of understanding of basic traffic rules.

### 7. Hesitation or Lack of Confidence
Being overly cautious can be as problematic as being reckless. Examiners look for confident, decisive driving. Hesitation at junctions, for example, can be marked down.

### 8. Poor Clutch Control (for manual vehicles)
Stalling the vehicle, especially on an incline, or jerky gear changes due to improper clutch use.

### 9. Incorrect Positioning on the Road
Driving too close to the curb, too far into the center of the road, or incorrect positioning for turns.

### 10. Panicking Under Pressure
Letting nerves get the better of you. Try to stay calm, breathe, and focus on one step at a time. If you make a small mistake, don't dwell on it; focus on recovering and driving safely.

Remember, the driving test assesses your ability to control the vehicle safely and follow traffic rules. Practice, awareness of these common mistakes, and a calm demeanor will significantly improve your chances of success. Good luck with your trial!
